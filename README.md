woo-product-importer
====================

A simple, free CSV importer for WooCommerce

**Cool Stuff You Can Do**
- Import Categories and Tags (Categories and Tags are created if they don't exist)
- Import Custom Fields
- Set Visibility on Custom Fields
- Map any CSV column to any Product field (No header row required, but if you happened to include one, I'll use it to take a stab at what goes where)
- Map multiple CSV columns to one Product field (last non-empty column wins, good for merging columns)
